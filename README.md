# ReflectSync

Fast, rsync-powered two-way file sync with SQLite metadata and optional SSH. Designed for very large trees, low RAM, and observability.

- **Rsync transport** \(latest rsync recommended\)
- **SQLite indexes** per side \(alpha / beta\) \+ base snapshot for true 3\-way merges
- **Incremental scans** with content hashes only when needed \(based on ctime\)
- **Realtime micro\-sync** for hot files \(debounced, safe on partial edits\)
- **SSH\-friendly**: stream remote deltas over stdin
- **Copy on Write:** local sync on COW filesystems \(e.g., btrfs\) uses copy on write, for significant time/space savings, and also maintains sparse files.

> Requires **Node.js 22+**.

## Status: NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION

**reflect is NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION USE YET!** There is still a significant todo list of subtle edge cases to handle, features to implement, tests to put in place, etc. Do not use this. Our plan is to finish this quickly, then put this into major production on https://cocalc.com, and then I'll update this README when it is much safer to trust reflect with your files.

Some differences compared to Mutagen, and todos:

- the command line options are different \-\- it's just inspired by Mutagen, not a drop in replacement
- conflicts are resolved using **last write wins** \(clocks are sync'd\), with close ties resolved by one chosen side always wins. There is no manual resolution mode.
- we use Sha\-256 by default, but also support "sha512", "blake2b512", "blake2s256", "sha3-256", and "sha3-512".
- only supports macos and linux \(currently\)
- timestamps and permissions are fully preserved, whereas Mutagen mostly ignores them

## Install

Project (local):

```bash
pnpm add reflect-sync
# or: npm i reflect-sync
```

Global (handy for ops boxes):

```bash
pnpm add -g reflect-sync
# then: reflect help
```

Build from source (dev):

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
```

The package exposes the `reflect` CLI (and aliases `rfsync` and `reflect-sync`) via its `bin` map.

---

## Quick start

### 1) One machine (both roots local)

```bash
reflect --help
reflect create /path/to/alpha /path/to/beta
reflect list
reflect status 1
reflect logs 1
```

- The scheduler runs a scan on each side, computes a 3-way plan, runs rsync, and repeats on an adaptive interval.
- File changes are pushed in realtime via a micro-sync path while the main loop verifies and updates the base snapshot for last write wins 3-way merge semantics.

### 2) One side over SSH

Two ways to do it:

```bash
reflect create user@alpha.example.com:/tmp/alpha /tmp/beta
# or specify a non-default SSH port
reflect create /tmp/beta alpha.example.com:2222:/srv/alpha
```

or

```bash
reflect create /tmp/beta user@alpha.example.com:/tmp/alpha
# default port 22 can also be written with a double colon
reflect create /tmp/beta alpha.example.com::/srv/alpha
```

The scheduler will SSH to `alpha-host`, run a remote scan that streams NDJSON deltas, and ingest them locally.

> Remote paths must begin with `/` or `~/`. The optional `:<port>` segment lives between the host and the path (`host:2222:/path`). A bare single colon or a double colon (`host:/path`, `host::/path`) uses the default port 22.

> Advanced plumbing commands (`scan`, `watch`, `scheduler`, …) are hidden from the default help to keep the interface ergonomic. Run `reflect --help --advanced` if you need to see or invoke them directly.

### Running as a daemon

The `reflect daemon` command keeps schedulers alive in the background:

```bash
reflect daemon start   # fire-and-forget supervisor (writes ~/.local/share/reflect-sync/daemon/reflect.pid)
reflect daemon status  # quick health check
reflect daemon stop    # terminate the supervisor
```

Use `reflect daemon install` to install a user service (systemd on Linux, LaunchAgent on macOS) that launches the daemon on login. The service runs `reflect daemon run` in the foreground, so you can also wire it into your own service manager.

### Common CLI commands

```bash
reflect create <alpha> <beta>         # start a new session
reflect list                          # list sessions
reflect status <id-or-name>                   # show heartbeat / merge status
reflect logs <id-or-name> [--follow]          # stream recent structured logs
reflect logs <id-or-name> --message progress  # tail only progress events (scan/hash/rsync/etc.)
reflect pause <id-or-name...>                 # pause one or more sessions
reflect resume <id-or-name...>                # resume (and auto-start scheduler if needed)
reflect terminate <id-or-name...>             # stop and remove session state
reflect daemon start                          # ensure the background supervisor is running
reflect daemon stop                           # stop the supervisor (removes the PID file)
```

All commands honor `--session-db <path>` if you want to keep session metadata outside the default location.

## How it works (short)

- **Scan** writes metadata (`path, size, ctime, mtime, hash, deleted, last_seen, hashed_ctime`) to SQLite. Hashing is streamed and parallelized; we only rehash when `ctime` changed since the last hash.
- **Merge** builds temp tables with _relative_ paths, computes the 3-way plan (changed A, changed B, deleted A/B, resolve conflicts by `--prefer`), then feeds rsync with NUL-separated `--files-from` lists.
- **Scheduler**:
  - shallow root watchers + bounded deep “hot” watchers (recently touched subtrees),
  - **micro-sync** a small list of hot files immediately,
  - periodically run a full scan + merge; interval adapts to prior cycle time and recent rsync errors.
  - **Progress logging:** hashing and rsync stages emit logs tagged with `message="progress"` plus scopes in the metadata. Use `reflect logs <id> --message progress -f` to observe in real time.

---

## Environment & scripts

- **Node.js**: `>= 22` (set in `engines`).
- **Build**: `pnpm build` (TypeScript → `dist/`), `rootDir=src`, `outDir=dist`.
- **Dev helpers**: `dev:scan`, `dev:ingest`, `dev:merge`, `dev:scheduler` run the TS sources via `tsx`.

---

## Typical file layout

You’ll end up with three DBs alongside your process (or wherever you point them):

- `alpha.db` — metadata for alpha root
- `beta.db` — metadata for beta root
- `base.db` — 3-way merge base (relative paths)

This separation makes it easy to relocate/rotate databases, inspect state, and compute user-facing reports (e.g. “what changed recently”, “top space users”).

---

## Troubleshooting

- **Inotify/FSEvents limits \(Linux/macOS\)**: scheduler uses shallow \+ bounded hot watchers. If you still hit limits, tune:
  - `MAX_HOT_WATCHERS` — cap number of deep watchers
  - `SHALLOW_DEPTH` — 0 or 1 recommended
  - `HOT_DEPTH` — typical 1–2

- **DB size**: large trees create large but inexpensive DBs. Use WAL mode \(default\) and SSDs for best throughput.

---

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm link -g .
reflect -h
```

TypeScript compiler outputs to `dist/.`

---

## Notes

- Executables are provided via `bin` and linked to the compiled files in `dist/`. If you’re hacking locally in this repo, either run `node dist/cli.js …` or `pnpm link --global .` to get `reflect` on your PATH.
- For SSH use, ensure the remote has Node 22\+ and `reflect` on PATH \(installed or included in your SEA image\). Then `reflect scan … --emit-delta | reflect ingest …` is all you need. Also, make sure you have ssh keys setup for passwordless login.

## Why ReflectSync?

**reflect-sync** is a two-way file sync tool written in Typescript with **deterministic Last-Write-Wins (LWW)** semantics, built on **rsync** for transfer and **SQLite** for state. It aims to be predictable, debuggable, and fast for the common case of **two roots** (e.g., laptop ↔ server, container bind-mount ↔ host, staging ↔ prod).

### Key properties

- **Deterministic LWW:** Changes are decided by content timestamps with a small configurable epsilon; ties break toward the **preferred side** you choose.
- **Hash-driven change detection:** Content hashes, not “mtime only,” determine whether a file actually changed—keeps plans stable and reduces churn.
- **First-class symlinks:** Links are scanned via `lstat`, targets are stored and hashed as **`link:<target>`**, and rsync preserves them.
- **Simple & inspectable:** Uses SQLite tables and NDJSON deltas—easy to debug, test, and reason about.
- **MIT-licensed:** Very permissive for both open-source and commercial use.

---

## When to use ReflectSync

When you want:

- **Two endpoints** with **predictable outcomes** (no “conflict copies”).
- Great performance on **large files** or **incremental edits** (thanks to rsync).
- **Transparent plans** and state you can audit (SQLite + file lists).
- **Symlink-accurate** behavior across platforms that support them.

Not a perfect fit if you need:

- A **multi\-node mesh** with discovery/relays \(see Syncthing/Resilio\).
- Built\-in **version history** or a cloud UI \(see Nextcloud/Dropbox\).
- **Interactive** conflict resolution UX \(see Unison\); with ReflectSync there is **never** conflict resolution.

## How it compares

| Tool            | License                             | Sync model                   | Conflict policy                   | Notes                                         |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **ReflectSync** | **MIT**                             | Two-way between two roots    | **LWW** (+ preferred side on tie) | rsync transport; SQLite state; symlink-aware  |
| **Unison**      | GPL-3                               | Two-way                      | Interactive or policy-driven      | Mature, formal; heavier UX for headless flows |
| **Syncthing**   | MPL-2.0                             | Continuous P2P mesh          | **Conflict copies** on diverge    | Great for many devices; background indexer    |
| **Mutagen**     | Source-available (see project docs) | Dev-focused low-latency sync | Modes incl. “prefer side”         | Very fast for dev trees; custom protocol      |
| **lsyncd**      | GPL-2.0+                            | One-way (event → rsync)      | N/A                               | Simple near-real-time mirroring               |

> Philosophy difference: **ReflectSync** favors _determinism without duplicates or "conflict" files_ \(LWW \+ preference\). Tools like Syncthing/Dropbox prefer _never lose data_ \(create conflict files\), which is ideal for less controlled, multi\-party edits.

---

## Semantics (brief)

- **Change detection:** By **content hash, permissions and \(for root\) uid/gid**. Pure mtime or ctime changes do NOT count as edits. However, when there is an edit, the file is transfered with the mtime properly synced.
- **Last write wins \(LWW\) resolution:** The newer op timestamp wins; within `--lww-epsilon-ms`, the **preferred side** wins.
- **Type changes:** File ↔ symlink ↔ dir follow the same LWW rule \(so type can change if the winner differs\).
- **Deletes:** Deletions are first\-class operations and replicate per LWW.
- **Symlinks:** Stored with target string and hashed as `<target>`; preserved by rsync.
- **Permission modes:** are always fully sync'd on posix systems.
- **UID/GID:** sync'd as numeric ids when the user is root; ignored otherwise.

---

## Performance notes

- **Large files / small edits:** Excellent even for high latency links \(rsync rolling checksums\).
- **Many small files:** Competitive when watch\-driven; initial cold scans take longer than always\-on indexers.
- **Observability:** Plans are explicit \(`toAlpha`, `toBeta`, delete lists\) and replayable. State is visible in sqlite tables. After each scan a hash of each directory tree is computed, so you can be certain the state has converged.

---

## Platform support

- **Linux / macOS:** Fully supported \(Node.js 22\+\). Uses `lutimes` where available for precise symlink mtimes.
- **Windows:** Works best via **WSL** or an rsync port. Symlink behavior depends on platform capabilities and permissions. Not yet tested for native Windows, but planned.

---

## Open Source

The MIT license is maximally permissive: embed, modify, and redistribute with minimal friction. This makes **ReflectSync** easy to adopt in both open\-source stacks and commercial tooling.

**Legend:**

- **LWW** = Last-Write-Wins. In ReflectSync, ties within `--lww-epsilon-ms` break toward your **preferred side** (alpha/beta).
- “Conflict copies” = tools that create duplicate files when both sides changed (e.g., `filename (conflict copy).txt`).

**Rule of thumb**

- Want **determinism** between **two roots** → pick **ReflectSync**.
- Want a **mesh** or **never lose data** via conflict files → pick **Syncthing** (or cloud sync).
- Want **dev-loop speed** → pick **Mutagen**.
- Want **one-way mirroring** → pick **lsyncd**.
- Want **history + sharing** → pick **Nextcloud/Dropbox**.
